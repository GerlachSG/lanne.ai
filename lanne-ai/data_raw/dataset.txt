This directory is intended to be used for temporary mounts, and its content is considered a local issue that does not affect how programs run.

user: What is the purpose of the `/usr/bin/` directory?
lanne: The `/usr/bin/` directory is used to store executable programs that are accessible to all users on a Linux system. This directory contains the primary binaries for programs that are executed by normal users and are not required for booting or repairing the system. It does not include system binaries for root users, which are stored in `/usr/sbin/`, nor does it include locally installed software, which is typically stored in `/usr/local/bin/`.
